# Fat Tree Generator
The Fat Tree Generator is a tool that allows to create arbitrary size Clos
topologies and configure them to run on Kathara. 


## Prerequisites

- Python3
- Kathar√† (https://www.kathara.org/)

## Usage 

### Configure the topology 

The configuration of the topology is described in `config.json` file. 

```
{
  "protocol": "bgp",    
  "pod_num": 2,
  "pod": {
    "spine_num": [2,2],
    "leaf_num" : 2,
    "servers_for_rack": 1
  },
  "aggregation_layer": {
    "tof_num": [2]
  }
}
```
Parameters explanations: 

- `protocol`: 
    - "bgp" (use the FRR implementation)
    - "open_fabric" (use the FRR implementation)
    - "rift" (ztp configuration) (use the rift-python implementation
       of Bruno Rijsman https://github.com/brunorijsman/rift-python)
       
- `pod_num`: used to specify the number of pod in the Clos topology 

- `spine_num`: an array of int used to specify the number of spine on each
  level of the pod ([2,2] means that there are two level of spine, composed
   by two spines, for each pod). 

- `leaf_number`: used to specify the number of leaf for each pod 

- `servers_for_rack`: used to specify the number of servers for each leaf 
  (considered as Top of Rack)
  
- `tof_num`: an array of int used to specify the number of ToF on each level
  of the aggregation layer ([2,2] means that there are two level of ToF, composed
   by two ToF). 


### Run the tool 

In order to run the tool, type on terminal: 

```
$ python3 main.py
```

After that a `lab` directory, with all the configurations files for 
Kathara, is created in the project folder. 
It also creates a `lab.json` file which contains all the information about
the topology and nodes. 

To run the lab, open a terminal in that folder and type: 

```
$ cd lab
$ sudo kathara lstart --privileged 
```

The `--privileged` flag is used to allow docker containers to use ECMP.

## Node name's syntax

All the nodes in the lab have a name that depend on their type and their
position in the topology: 
- `server_<pod_number>_<server_number>`
- `leaf_<pod_number>_<level>_<leaf_number>` (level is always 0 for a leaf)
- `spine_<pod_number>_<level>_<spine_number>`
- `tof_<level>_<tof_number>`


## Topology information
It's possible to consult the `lab.json` file to know all the information on
topology and nodes. 
It's also possible to use the `get_ip.py` script to get the nodes ips 
of the generated lab. 

To get all the ips in the network type on terminal: 
```
$ python3 get_ip.py
```

To get the ips of a particular type of nodes type on terminal: 
```
$ python3 get_ip.py type
```
Possible values for `type` param are: 
 - server
 - leaf
 - spine 
 - tof
